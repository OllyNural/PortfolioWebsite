Hey David! I saw your post on the retro game: https://dry.ly/2018/retro-rpg-party-invitation/, and instantly wanted to recreate it and do a version myself - this time as part of a Christmas present to my girlfriend.

We own a bunch of stuffed animals, and although i'm not the best coder, I just about managed to play around with your code and make an incredibly similar and reskinned version. I have to say it was really fun, and easy to work with! 

I just wanted to say thank you for creating such a nice to follow blog, and also writing some damn cool code - some of the logic around clock time, as well as calculating with sin/tan is awesome, and is something I would have never considered.

If you're interested, the site is here: http://localhost:3000/ilene/peanut (The code is grim as I rushed to make it in a few days!)
